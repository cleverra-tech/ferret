# Ferret: High-Performance Zig Web Framework

Ferret is a production-ready, high-performance web framework for Zig. It provides complete HTTP/1.1, HTTP/2, and HTTP/3 protocol support with advanced networking capabilities, cryptographic functions, and a comprehensive suite of data structures and utilities.

## Project Status: v0.1.0-alpha

Ferret has evolved into a comprehensive web framework with full protocol implementations and production-ready features.

### Completed Components

#### Core Foundation
- **Memory Management**: Advanced allocators including pool, tracking, arena, fixed buffer, and specialized allocators
- **Type System**: Complete generic types with `Ref<T>`, `Optional<T>`, `Result<T,E>`, and `Slice<T>`
- **Atomic Operations**: Production-ready lock-free primitives, spinlocks, RW locks, atomic counters, and queues
- **Time Utilities**: High-precision timestamps, durations, timers, timeouts, rate limiters, and scheduling
- **Configuration System**: JSON-based configuration with environment variable support

#### Data Structures & Collections
- **Array<T>**: Dynamic arrays with automatic resizing, slicing, and comprehensive operations
- **HashMap<K,V>**: High-performance hash maps using robin hood hashing with collision handling
- **String**: Binary-safe strings with UTF-8 support, efficient operations, and formatting
- **Queue<T>**: Thread-safe queues with multiple implementation strategies
- **Buffer**: High-performance I/O buffers with automatic growth and memory management

#### Networking & I/O
- **Reactor**: Epoll-based event loop system with edge-triggered mode for maximum performance
- **Socket Management**: Complete socket abstraction with automatic resource management
- **Connection Pooling**: Efficient connection reuse and lifecycle management
- **Protocol Detection**: Automatic HTTP version negotiation and protocol switching

#### HTTP Protocol Suite
- **HTTP/1.1**: Full RFC 7230-7235 compliant implementation with keep-alive, chunked encoding
- **HTTP/2**: Complete RFC 7540 implementation with binary framing, HPACK compression, multiplexing
- **HTTP/3**: QUIC-based HTTP/3 with QPACK compression, 0-RTT connections, connection migration
- **WebSocket**: RFC 6455 compliant WebSocket with frame processing and compression support
- **Unified API**: Single interface supporting all HTTP versions with automatic protocol selection

#### Cryptographic Functions
- **Hashing**: SHA-256, SHA-512, MD5, HMAC with streaming support
- **Symmetric Encryption**: AES-256, ChaCha20-Poly1305 with authenticated encryption
- **Asymmetric Cryptography**: RSA, Ed25519, X25519 for key exchange and digital signatures

#### JSON Processing
- **High-Performance Parser**: Streaming JSON parser with minimal memory allocation
- **Type-Safe Serialization**: Compile-time JSON mapping with Zig structs
- **Streaming Support**: Large JSON document processing with constant memory usage

### Architecture Highlights

- **Explicit Memory Management**: All APIs require explicit allocator parameters with zero hidden allocations
- **Compile-time Code Generation**: Leverages Zig's `comptime` for type-safe generics and zero-cost abstractions
- **Performance-First Design**: Sub-microsecond protocol parsing, zero-copy operations where possible
- **RFC Compliance**: Full compliance with HTTP/1.1 (RFC 7230-7235), HTTP/2 (RFC 7540), HTTP/3 (RFC 9114)
- **Memory Safety**: Comprehensive leak detection, bounds checking, and safe memory operations
- **Error Handling**: Comprehensive error types with clear propagation and recovery mechanisms
- **Cross-platform Compatibility**: Built on Zig's target system supporting Linux, macOS, Windows

pub fn main() !void {
    var gpa = std.heap.GeneralPurposeAllocator(.{}){};
    defer _ = gpa.deinit();
    const allocator = gpa.allocator();

    // Create HTTP client with automatic protocol negotiation
    var client = try ferret.Http.Client.init(allocator);
    defer client.deinit();

    // Make HTTP/3 request with QUIC transport
    var request = ferret.Http.Request.init(allocator, .GET, "/api/data");
    defer request.deinit();
    
    const response = try client.send(&request, "api.example.com", 443);
    defer response.deinit();
    
    std.log.info("Response status: {}", .{response.status});
    std.log.info("Protocol: {s}", .{@tagName(response.version)});
}
